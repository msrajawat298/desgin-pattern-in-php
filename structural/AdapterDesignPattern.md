The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. The adapter acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together.

Here's an example of implementing the Adapter Design Pattern in PHP:

1. **Target Interface:**
   - Define the target interface that the client code expects.

   ```php
   interface Target {
       public function request();
   }
   ```

2. **Adaptee:**
   - Create a class that has an incompatible interface (Adaptee).

   ```php
   class Adaptee {
       public function specificRequest() {
           return "Adaptee's specific request";
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Adapter:**
   - Implement the target interface in the adapter class, which delegates the request to the methods of the adaptee.

   ```php
   class Adapter implements Target {
       private $adaptee;

       public function __construct(Adaptee $adaptee) {
           $this->adaptee = $adaptee;
       }

       public function request() {
           return "Adapter: " . $this->adaptee->specificRequest();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Client Code:**
   - Use the target interface in the client code, which interacts with the adapter.

   ```php
   function clientCode(Target $target) {
       echo $target->request() . "\n";
   }
   ```

5. **Usage Example:**
   - Instantiate the adaptee, create an adapter, and use it in the client code.

   ```php
   $adaptee = new Adaptee();
   $adapter = new Adapter($adaptee);

   clientCode($adapter);
   ```

In this example:

- The `Target` interface declares the method expected by the client code.
- The `Adaptee` class has a method (`specificRequest`) that is incompatible with the `Target` interface.
- The `Adapter` class implements the `Target` interface and contains an instance of the `Adaptee`. It delegates the `request` method to the `specificRequest` method of the `Adaptee`.
- The client code (`clientCode`) expects an instance of the `Target` interface and can work with both the `Adaptee` and the `Adapter`.

The Adapter Design Pattern is particularly useful when integrating new components or libraries into an existing system without modifying the existing codebase. It allows for a smoother transition and compatibility between different interfaces.
