- # Q 1. How can I structure my PHP code to implement Hexagonal Architecture effectively?
## Ans. Implementing Hexagonal Architecture effectively in PHP involves structuring your code into three main parts: the Domain, the Ports, and the Adapters. Here's a general guide on how to structure your code:

- 1. Domain: This is the core of your application, where all the business logic resides. It should be completely independent of any specific infrastructure or user interface. It's usually composed of entities (business objects) and use cases (business operations).

```php
// Domain/Entities/Product.php
class Product {
    // ...
}

// Domain/UseCases/CreateProduct.php
class CreateProduct {
    // ...
}
```

- 2. Ports: These are interfaces that define the inputs and outputs of your domain. There are two types of ports: Primary (or driving) ports, which represent the inputs to your domain (like a use case), and Secondary (or driven) ports, which represent the outputs from your domain (like a repository).

```php
// Domain/Ports/ProductRepository.php
interface ProductRepository {
    // ...
}

// Domain/Ports/CreateProductInput.php
interface CreateProductInput {
    // ...
}
```

- 3. Adapters: These are the implementations of your ports. They adapt the inputs and outputs of your domain to specific external systems or interfaces. For example, you might have a WebAdapter that adapts your domain to a web interface, and a SqlProductRepository that adapts your domain to a SQL database.

```php
// Infrastructure/Adapters/SqlProductRepository.php
class SqlProductRepository implements ProductRepository {
    // ...
}

// Infrastructure/Adapters/WebAdapter.php
class WebAdapter implements CreateProductInput {
    // ...
}
```

- 4. Application: This is where you wire everything together. You create instances of your adapters and use them to create instances of your use cases. Then you call the methods on your use cases to perform business operations.

```php
// Application/index.php
$productRepository = new SqlProductRepository();
$createProduct = new CreateProduct($productRepository);
$webAdapter = new WebAdapter($createProduct);
$webAdapter->handleHttpRequest();
```

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you would likely have many more entities, use cases, ports, and adapters. You might also use a dependency injection container to manage your objects and their dependencies.

- 1. How can I handle dependency injection in Hexagonal Architecture with PHP?


Dependency Injection is a technique that can be used to manage dependencies between objects, and it fits well with Hexagonal Architecture. In PHP, you can use a Dependency Injection Container (DIC) to manage your objects and their dependencies.

Here's a simplified example of how you might do this with PHP-DI, a popular DIC for PHP:

- 1. Define your dependencies: You define your dependencies in a configuration file. This tells the DIC how to create instances of your objects.
```php
// di-config.php
return [
    ProductRepository::class => DI\create(SqlProductRepository::class),
    CreateProduct::class => DI\autowire()->constructorParameter('productRepository', DI\get(ProductRepository::class)),
    WebAdapter::class => DI\autowire()->constructorParameter('createProductInput', DI\get(CreateProduct::class)),
];
```
- 2. Create the DIC: You create an instance of the DIC and pass it your configuration file.
```php
// bootstrap.php
$container = DI\ContainerBuilder::buildDevContainer(require 'di-config.php');
```
- 3. Use the DIC: You use the DIC to create instances of your objects. The DIC automatically injects the correct dependencies.

```php
// index.php
require 'bootstrap.php';

$webAdapter = $container->get(WebAdapter::class);
$webAdapter->handleHttpRequest();
```
In this example, when you ask the DIC for an instance of WebAdapter, it automatically creates an instance of CreateProduct (which in turn gets an instance of ProductRepository), and injects it into the WebAdapter.

This is a very simplified example. In a real-world application, you would likely have many more dependencies, and your configuration file would be more complex. You might also use different strategies for managing your dependencies, such as service providers or factory methods.
