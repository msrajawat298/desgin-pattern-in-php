The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with a large number of possible configurations or when the construction steps need to be performed in a specific order.

Here's an example of implementing the Builder Design Pattern in PHP:

```php
<?php

// Product
class Computer {
    private $CPU;
    private $RAM;
    private $storage;
    private $graphicsCard;

    public function setCPU($CPU) {
        $this->CPU = $CPU;
    }

    public function setRAM($RAM) {
        $this->RAM = $RAM;
    }

    public function setStorage($storage) {
        $this->storage = $storage;
    }

    public function setGraphicsCard($graphicsCard) {
        $this->graphicsCard = $graphicsCard;
    }

    public function showDetails() {
        return "Computer details: CPU - {$this->CPU}, RAM - {$this->RAM}, Storage - {$this->storage}, Graphics Card - {$this->graphicsCard}";
    }
}

// Builder interface
interface ComputerBuilder {
    public function buildCPU();
    public function buildRAM();
    public function buildStorage();
    public function buildGraphicsCard();
    public function getResult(): Computer;
}

// Concrete builder
class HighEndComputerBuilder implements ComputerBuilder {
    private $computer;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->computer = new Computer();
    }

    public function buildCPU() {
        $this->computer->setCPU("High-end CPU");
    }

    public function buildRAM() {
        $this->computer->setRAM("16GB RAM");
    }

    public function buildStorage() {
        $this->computer->setStorage("1TB SSD");
    }

    public function buildGraphicsCard() {
        $this->computer->setGraphicsCard("NVIDIA RTX 3080");
    }

    public function getResult(): Computer {
        return $this->computer;
    }
}

// Director
class ComputerDirector {
    public function buildComputer(ComputerBuilder $builder) {
        $builder->buildCPU();
        $builder->buildRAM();
        $builder->buildStorage();
        $builder->buildGraphicsCard();
    }
}

// Client code
$highEndBuilder = new HighEndComputerBuilder();
$director = new ComputerDirector();

$director->buildComputer($highEndBuilder);
$highEndComputer = $highEndBuilder->getResult();

echo $highEndComputer->showDetails();
?>
```

In this example, we have a `Computer` class representing the product. The `ComputerBuilder` interface declares the construction steps, and the `HighEndComputerBuilder` is a concrete builder implementing those steps. The `ComputerDirector` class is responsible for orchestrating the construction process.

Client code creates a specific builder (e.g., `HighEndComputerBuilder`), passes it to the director (`ComputerDirector`), and gets the result, which is the complex object (`Computer`). This way, you can create different types of computers with different configurations using the same director and different builders.
