The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create copies (clones) of existing objects without making the code dependent on their classes. This pattern involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It's useful when the cost of creating a new instance of an object is more expensive or complex than copying an existing one.

Here's an example of implementing the Prototype Design Pattern in PHP:

```php
<?php

// Prototype interface
interface Prototype {
    public function clone();
}

// Concrete prototype
class Sheep implements Prototype {
    private $name;
    private $color;

    public function __construct($name, $color) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function setName($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setColor($color) {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function getColor() {
        return $this->color;
    }

    // Clone method to create a shallow copy
    public function clone() {
        return clone $this;
    }
}

// Client code
$originalSheep = new Sheep("Dolly", "White");

// Clone the original sheep
$clonedSheep1 = $originalSheep->clone();
$clonedSheep1->setName("Dolly Jr.");

$clonedSheep2 = $originalSheep->clone();
$clonedSheep2->setColor("Black");

// Display details
echo "Original Sheep: {$originalSheep->getName()}, {$originalSheep->getColor()}\n";
echo "Cloned Sheep 1: {$clonedSheep1->getName()}, {$clonedSheep1->getColor()}\n";
echo "Cloned Sheep 2: {$clonedSheep2->getName()}, {$clonedSheep2->getColor()}\n";
?>
```

In this example, we have a `Sheep` class that implements the `Prototype` interface. The `clone` method creates a shallow copy of the object using the `clone` keyword. The client code creates an original sheep and then clones it to create new instances. The clones can have their properties modified independently.

It's important to note that the `clone` method in PHP creates a shallow copy by default. If your object contains references to other objects, you might need to implement a deep copy method or use a combination of `clone` and additional logic to handle nested objects.
